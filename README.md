In this course project, I developed a command-line course planner application that reads course data from a CSV file, stores it efficiently, and allows users to retrieve course details and prerequisites. The key challenge was organizing and searching the data quickly, especially when dealing with large datasets. To address this, I utilized a hash table for fast course lookups and a vector to maintain a sortable list of course names. Understanding the strengths of these data structures was essential for achieving performance and accuracy. Throughout the development process, I encountered roadblocks but I am luck that I have a husband who works in coding so I was able to use him to help me.  

This project expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing modular structure, reusable components, and pre-planned architecture. By focusing on clean logic and scalable structures, I created a program that can be easily updated or enhanced in the future. Overall, this project sharpened my ability to write code that is not only functional but also sustainable for long-term use.
